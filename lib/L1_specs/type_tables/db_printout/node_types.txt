1	Freeway	Nodes at on-ramp/interconnect merges, off-ramp/interconnect splits, HOV/HOT gates on freeways.
2	Highway	Nodes at on-ramp/interconnect merges, off-ramp/interconnect splits, HOV/HOT gates on freeways.
3	Signalized Intersection	Signals can be placed on nodes only of this type.
4	Stop Intersection	An Interection where traffic is required to stop.
5	Simple	Single-Input-Single-Output (SISO) node, where the input and the output links have the same properties.
6	Terminal	Node that has only 1 input or only 1 output link – it is either the begin node for an origin link, or the end node for the destination link.
